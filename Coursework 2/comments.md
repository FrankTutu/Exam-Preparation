Performance evauation:

1)tree.py (without the use of numpy)
From the graph it can be observed the time taken to run the file exhibits a exponential increase or a x**2 function law as the number of generations are increased. 

2)tree_np.py (with the use of numpy)
The performance of this file is quite consistent and towards the end for 10 generations, it still is at least 10 times faster than the tree.py file. There is only a slight increase in the time taken to run the file as the number of generations are increased as opposed to tree.py.
